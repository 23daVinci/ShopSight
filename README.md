# 🛍️ ShopSight: AI-Powered Visual Search Engine

**ShopSight** is a visual search engine designed to revolutionize e-commerce product discovery. Instead of relying on text keywords, users can upload an image (e.g., a specific shoe or shirt) to find visually similar items from a product inventory.

Powered by Vision Transformers (ViT) and Milvus Vector Database, ShopSight converts images into high-dimensional vector embeddings to perform lightning-fast similarity searches.
